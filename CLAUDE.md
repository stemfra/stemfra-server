Node/Express backend serving CMS, Platform, CRM, n8n, and marketing-site concerns for the Stemfra platform. Companion file to `~/Documents/stemfra/stemfra_platform/CLAUDE.md` (the customer-facing monorepo) and `~/Documents/stemfra/stemfra-ops/CLAUDE.md` (the internal CRM). When working in `stemfra_server/`, this file is the source of truth.

If a new Claude Code session reads only one file before starting work here, this is it. Read top to bottom once, then refer back when needed.

## What this service is

One Node/Express process at `localhost:4000` that, today, handles five concerns side by side. The split is deliberate: ship one service until operational evidence justifies splitting (see section 9). Trying to architect microservices before there's any operational signal would burn weeks of plumbing time we don't have.

The five concerns:

1. **CMS endpoints** (`/api/cms/*`) — server-side counterpart to the customer CMS at `localhost:5180`. Today, just image upload + delete via Cloudinary. Future slices add content-section CRUD, services/team CRUD, booking calendar reads, etc.
2. **Platform booking endpoints** (`/api/site-forms/*`, `/api/site-bookings/*`) — public endpoints called by the customer-facing template sites at `localhost:5174-5177`. Lead form submission, availability calculation, booking writes. This is the Mode N native scheduler.
3. **CRM Twilio voice + SMS + presence** (`/api/twilio/*`, `/api/presence/*`) — the call/SMS rails for the internal CRM at `localhost:5173`. Includes a background presence sweeper that flips stale CRM users offline.
4. **n8n webhook bridge** (`/api/leadgen/*`, `/api/speed-to-lead/*`) — proxies CRM events into n8n workflows hosted on the same VPS, gated by a shared secret.
5. **Marketing-site contact + insights** (`/api/contact`, `/api/insights/*`) — the contact form on `stemfra.com` and CRUD for the public-facing Insights/blog content.

All Supabase writes use the service-role key (server-trusted, bypasses RLS). The browser-side apps each have their own anon-key clients for read-side queries.

## Local dev

```bash
cd ~/Documents/stemfra/stemfra_server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real secrets locally
npm run dev            # nodemon, listens on :4000
```

Loads `.env` via `require('dotenv').config()` at the top of `index.js`. If you run individual modules with `node -r dotenv/config -e "..."` to typecheck them, you'll need the `-r dotenv/config` flag — the modules' strict env checks (`config/supabase.js` exits if `SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is missing) will hard-fail without it.

`/health` returns `200 OK` for liveness probes. Healthcheck for the CMS upload subsystem is `/api/cms/site-uploads/healthcheck` (returns whether Cloudinary env vars are loaded).

Peter previews the customer CMS in his own browser; this server backs that preview. When Peter has the CMS open, he often runs `stemfra_server` in his own terminal. **If port 4000 is already in use, don't start a second instance.** Edit files in place and let nodemon reload, then `curl` against the running instance.

## Environment variables

Full list lives in `.env.example` (committed as documentation only — never put real secrets there). Grouped by purpose:

**Server runtime**
- `NODE_ENV` (`production` in deploy; `development` locally)
- `PORT=4000`
- `CLIENT_URL` (dev origin for CORS; production frontends are hardcoded in `index.js`)
- `API_HOST` (used by Traefik labels in `docker-compose.yml`, not read by the app)
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (the externally-reachable HTTPS base; required for Twilio webhook signing)

**Supabase**
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (the new `sb_secret_...` form; server-side; bypasses RLS)

The server uses the **service-role key only — no anon key is required**. The service-role client can introspect end-user JWTs via `supabase.auth.getUser(jwt)`, which is what `middleware/cmsAuth.js` does to authenticate CMS users without needing a second anon-keyed client.

**Email (Gmail SMTP via Nodemailer)**
- `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (App Password, NOT the account password)
- `NOTIFY_EMAIL` (where contact-form notifications land)
- `LOGO_URL` (optional — has a hardcoded fallback)

**Twilio**
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (signature validation requires the auth token)
- `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID`, `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET` (Voice SDK token endpoint)
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` (E.164)
- `TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID` (the TwiML App whose Voice URL points at `/api/twilio/voice`)

**n8n bridge (lead-gen + speed-to-lead)**
- `N8N_LEADGEN_COLD_URL`, `N8N_LEADGEN_WARM_URL` (production webhook paths in n8n; `/webhook/...`, NOT `/webhook-test/...`)
- `N8N_SPEED_TO_LEAD_URL` (separate workflow; may be blank until the workflow is built — server returns 503 if unset)
- `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (sent as `x-leadgen-secret` header; n8n workflow verifies)

The n8n URLs use the **public hostname**, not loopback. `stemfra_server` and `n8n` run as sibling Docker containers; `127.0.0.1` from inside `stemfra_server` resolves to that container, not the VPS. See the [Docker container loopback gotcha](../docker_container_loopback_gotcha.md) memory.

**Cloudinary** (new in Slice 2c)
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

All three are required. `config/cloudinary.js` logs a warning at boot if any are missing (`isCloudinaryConfigured()` returns false; healthcheck reflects this). For production, all three must be added to the GitHub Actions secrets and to the deploy workflow's `environment-variables` block (see section 10 — there's a current gap to close).

## CMS endpoints (under `/api/cms/*`)

Established in Slice 2c. All three endpoints live under `/api/cms/site-uploads/*` with handlers in `controllers/cms/uploadController.js` and the route file at `routes/cms/siteUploads.js`. The `/api/cms/*` prefix and `routes/cms/` + `controllers/cms/` directories are deliberate — they establish the seam for a future microservice split (see section 9).

**`GET /api/cms/site-uploads/healthcheck`** — `healthcheck` in `controllers/cms/uploadController.js`. Unauthenticated. Returns `{ ok: true, cloudinary_configured: <bool>, endpoint: "cms/site-uploads", version: "2c" }`. Does NOT call Cloudinary — only checks that the three env vars are present. Used by post-deploy verification and uptime monitors to catch "deploy forgot the secrets" failures.

**`POST /api/cms/site-uploads/upload`** — `uploadImage` in `controllers/cms/uploadController.js` (the function name is a Slice 2c legacy — it now handles images AND videos). Auth-gated by `requireCmsAuth`. Multipart form: field `siteId` (UUID), optional field `alt` (images only), file `image` (the field name is a transport label, not a content check). MIME-sniffs the file part and routes:

- **Image** (`image/jpeg|png|webp|gif`): `resource_type: 'image'`, transcoded to WebP via `format: 'webp'` + `quality: 'auto:good'`. 8 MB input cap (busboy hard limit 10 MB + handler check at 8 MB). DB row's `mime_type` normalized to `'image/webp'` (output, not input). Stored URL ends in `.webp`. Inputs 5–10× larger than outputs in practice.
- **Video** (`video/mp4` only in v1): `resource_type: 'video'`, no transform. 50 MB cap. DB row keeps `mime_type: 'video/mp4'`. Server does NOT enforce duration; client (`VideoUploadField`) shows a soft warning above 15 s with an "Upload anyway" option.
- Other MIMEs → 400.

**Cloudinary folder = `site.subdomain`** (Phase 2; e.g. `argyle-and-sons/{hash}`). Human-readable in the dashboard, easy bulk-delete per customer. `verifySiteOwnership` already returns the site row including subdomain — no extra DB read. Subdomain stability is guaranteed by the locked-down Settings UI; if subdomain changes ever become supported, this convention will need a migration step. **Pre-Phase-2 uploads** (`sites/{uuid}/{hash}`) coexist — their absolute Cloudinary URLs still resolve, no migration done.

On success: streams the file directly into `cloudinary.uploader.upload_stream` (never buffers in memory), then writes a `site_media` row with `storage_provider='cloudinary'`, `storage_key=result.public_id` (e.g. `argyle-and-sons/{hash}`), `original_url=result.secure_url`, and returns `{ mediaId, secure_url, public_id, width, height, bytes, format, mime_type, resource_type }`.

**`DELETE /api/cms/site-uploads/:mediaId`** — `deleteMedia` in `controllers/cms/uploadController.js`. Auth-gated. Looks up the `site_media` row, calls `verifySiteOwnership` against `media.site_id`, derives `resource_type` from the stored `mime_type` (videos require `resource_type: 'video'` for Cloudinary destroy), then calls `cloudinary.uploader.destroy(storage_key, { resource_type })` followed by the DB row delete. Best-effort on the Cloudinary side: if `destroy` throws, the row is still deleted (we don't want stuck rows blocking ongoing edits). Returns `{ ok: true }`.

**`POST /api/cms/site-uploads/copy`** — `copyMedia` (added 2026-07-09, cross-site image reuse). `{ sourceMediaId, targetSiteId }`: verifies the owner owns BOTH the source asset's site and the target site, then Cloudinary-duplicates the image into the target's subdomain folder (server-to-server pull of the existing delivery URL — no re-transcode, source is already WebP) + inserts a new `site_media` row. A snapshot COPY, deliberately not a shared reference, so per-site folder bulk-delete + the `referenced` scan stay accurate and deleting the original never breaks the copy. Images only (videos 400). Same-site pick returns the original (`copied:false`). Consumed by the CMS `MediaSourceModal` Library tab's site picker.

**`GET /api/cms/site-uploads?siteId=<uuid>`** — `listMedia` in `controllers/cms/uploadController.js` (added 2026-06-16 for the CMS Media library). Auth + `verifySiteOwnership`. Returns the site's `site_media` rows newest-first, each with a best-effort **`referenced`** boolean ("In use" / "Unused"). `buildUsageHaystack` serializes everything that can point at an asset — `site_sections.content` + `site_services` + `site_team_members` + `site_testimonials` + `site_theme_settings` — into one string; an asset is `referenced` if its **id, original_url, OR storage_key** appears in it. Shape-agnostic on purpose (media ids live in many nested JSONB shapes); the storage_key/public_id match catches references that stored a transformed Cloudinary URL. Powers the Media library grid + the reuse asset-picker; deletes warn harder when `referenced`.

**Custom-domain connect (`/api/cms/site-domain`, added 2026-06-23)** — `controllers/cms/domainController.js` + `routes/cms/siteDomain.js`. Owner self-serve brand-domain connect from the CMS Settings → Domain card, all gated by `requireCmsAuth` + `verifySiteOwnership`:
- **`POST /`** `{ siteId, domain }` — `connect`. Mirrors the admin `setCustomDomain` Cloudflare logic (`attachCustomDomain` to the vertical's Pages project via `projectFor`; adds our CNAME only for `*.stemfra.com` hosts), writes `sites.custom_domain`, returns `{ domain, cnameTarget: "{project}.pages.dev", status }`.
- **`GET /?siteId=`** `status` — current `custom_domain` + live CF status.
- **`DELETE /`** `{ siteId }` — `disconnect` (detach + clear). The admin/CRM path (`controllers/admin/sitesController.js`) is intentionally NOT refactored — staff can still assign domains too; keep the two CF blocks in sync.

**Brand logo import (`/api/cms/brand-logo`, P25 phase 1, 2026-09-10)** — `controllers/cms/brandLogoController.js`: `GET /lookup?siteId=&domain=` (domain → `companies.website` → `custom_domain`; candidates from Brandfetch [`BRANDFETCH_API_KEY`, optional], the site's HTML icons, Google's favicon service) and `POST /import {siteId, src, source, label}` (Cloudinary into the site folder, SVG kept, rasters capped WebP, `site_media` provenance `metadata.source = brand-logo:<source>`). Same shape as the stock-photos controller; keys never reach the browser. **Phase 2 (2026-09-11), the SVG builder**: `GET /icons?q=` + `GET /icon?name=prefix:icon` proxy Iconify (search, then the icon's inner markup + box), `GET /font?family=&weight=` resolves a Google Fonts TrueType URL (empty User-Agent → TTF; single-weight faces fall back to 400) that the CMS outlines with opentype.js, and `POST /build {siteId, svg, kind: logo|favicon, label, params}` validates the SVG (must be a bare `<svg>` document, no script / foreignObject / image / event handlers, 400 KB) and stores it like an import (favicon → Cloudinary PNG 256; `site_media.metadata.source = brand-logo:builder` + `builder` params). `index.js` gives `/api/cms/brand-logo` a 600 KB JSON limit ahead of the global 10 KB.

**Owner "buy a domain" (`/api/cms/site-domain/{search,check,register}`, added 2026-07-05)** — same controller/routes, Hostinger-style self-serve purchase (Peter's call: instant buy + invoice, gated on an ACTIVE platform subscription). Registrar = Porkbun via `lib/registrar`:
- **`GET /search?siteId=&q=`** — ONE live `checkDomain` for the exact query (`q` without a dot → `q.com`; ⚠️ Porkbun rate-limits checkDomain ~1/10s account-wide — never call per keystroke) + alternates from the curated TLD set (`com net co studio salon spa shop online`) priced from **`getPricing()`** (new in `lib/registrar/porkbun.js` — public `/pricing/get`, cached 24h in-process, NOT rate-limited). Alternates return `available: null`.
- **`GET /check?siteId=&domain=`** — one live availability check for an alternate row (on-demand "Check" button).
- **`POST /register`** `{ siteId, domain, dryRun? }` — gates: ownership, no existing `custom_domain` (disconnect first). ⚠ **The old `subscriptions.status='active'` gate is GONE** (it dead-ended every commission-era tenant, who have no subscriptions row); the subscription is now OPTIONAL and the invoice rides `billing_charges` with a nullable `subscription_id`. Purchase mode is the prepaid-float model (instant while the Porkbun balance ≥ $30, invoice-first below) — see `docs/DOMAINS.md`; **live end-to-end since the first real purchase 2026-08-10**. Fresh `checkDomain` → `register` (WHOIS privacy on; **`dryRun` honored only when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`**) → best-effort apex ALIAS + www CNAME + CF `attachCustomDomain` → `sites.custom_domain` → **`billing_charges` insert** (kind `adjustment`, retail price, due +7d — the cms_notifications DB trigger turns this into the owner's bell notification automatically) → `logSiteActivity('domain_registered')`. Mirrors `controllers/admin/domainsController.js registerDomain`; keep the two in sync.
- **⚠️ Porkbun account prerequisites (found 2026-07-05, blocks ALL registration incl. dryRun):** the Porkbun ACCOUNT must have **email + phone verified** (porkbun.com/account → error `VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` until done) and the **prepaid balance funded** (domain/create draws from balance). Peter action. Search/check/pricing work regardless.

**Case 7 — DNS moves to a Cloudflare ZONE at purchase (2026-07-10).** Both register paths (owner `registerOwn` + admin `registerDomain`) now also call `lib/domainZone.js provisionDomainZone(domain, pagesTarget)` — the shared orchestrator (keep both callers on it, never inline): create a CF zone in our account (`lib/cloudflareZones.js`, idempotent) → point Porkbun nameservers at the zone's assigned pair (`porkbun.updateNameServers`, POST /domain/updateNs) → proxied apex+www CNAMEs in the zone → enable **Email Routing**. The Porkbun ALIAS/www records the register flow already creates stay in place — they serve during NS propagation, then CF's nameservers take over. Zone ids are NOT persisted; look zones up by domain name (`getZoneByName`). BYO connect-only domains never get a zone (we don't take custody). **⚠️ CF token prerequisite:** the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN must carry `Zone:Zone:Edit`, `Zone:DNS:Edit`, `Zone:Email Routing Rules:Edit` (all zones from account) + `Account:Email Routing Addresses:Edit` — probed missing 2026-07-10; Peter action (dashboard token edit + .env + the Actions secret).

**Owner email forwarding (`/api/cms/site-email`, Case 11, added 2026-07-10)** — `controllers/cms/emailController.js` + `routes/cms/siteEmail.js`, requireCmsAuth + verifySiteOwnership. Free Cloudflare Email Routing aliases on Stemfra-registered domains (receive-only; mailboxes = Titan v2, parked): `GET /?siteId=` (zoneStatus/routingEnabled/aliases with per-destination `verified`), `POST /` `{siteId, alias, destination}` (registers the destination — Cloudflare emails it a verification link — then creates the rule; 20-alias cap), `DELETE /` `{siteId, ruleId}` (rule must belong to the site's own zone). Gates: 409 `no_domain` (no custom_domain) / 409 `unmanaged_domain` (BYO — zone not in our account). **PRIVACY (load-bearing):** CF destination addresses are ACCOUNT-level, shared across every customer — only ever return the destinations referenced by THIS site's rules, never the raw account list. Audits `email_alias_created`/`email_alias_deleted` via logSiteActivity. CMS consumer: `stemfra_cms` `lib/useSiteEmail.ts` + `components/settings/EmailSection.tsx` (Settings → Domain).

**Owner "+ New site" (`POST /api/cms/sites`, added 2026-06-23)** — `controllers/cms/sitesController.js` + `routes/cms/sites.js`, `requireCmsAuth`. Existing owner provisions an ADDITIONAL site (multi-site): `resolveContactId(jwt)` → insert a new `companies` row → `provisionSite({ vertical, companyId, ownerContactId, displayName, city })` (the proven seed-clone lib; rolls itself back on failure, and we delete the orphan company on its failure) → best-effort `attachSiteDomain` (site still provisions if CF is down). Returns `{ siteId, subdomain, previewUrl, status, domain }`. Mirrors `onboardCustomer` minus the auth-user/contact creation (the owner already exists).

**Site cloning + Starters (2026-07-01)** — full arc doc: `stemfra_platform/docs/CLONING_AND_STARTERS.md`. `lib/provisionSite.js` now exports **`cloneSite(sourceSiteId, …)`** (+ shared `cloneContent`) — clones ANY site EXACTLY, including `site_theme_settings` + the source's exact `template_id` (the `cloneThemeSettings` flag is what distinguishes it from `provisionSite`, which skips theme_settings so a fresh customer gets clean template defaults). Rolls back on failure; copies design+catalog+content, NOT bookings/leads/customers/billing. Four callers, one core: (1) **owner** `POST /api/cms/sites/clone` (`cloneOwnSite`, ownership-checked, writes a `site_cloned` audit); (2) **admin** `POST /api/admin/sites/:id/clone` (`cloneAdmin`, `PLATFORM_OPS`, new account via `onboardCustomer` `cloneSourceId` → temp password); (3) **Starters** — `lib/starters.js` (`metadata.is_starter` whitelist), `GET /api/starters[?vertical=]` (public catalog), `onboardCustomer({ starterId })` clones an approved Starter (starterId = subdomain OR id); the 4 fixtures + 9 demo sites are flagged Starters; (4) **Stacy S3** — `assistantController.send` relays a whitelisted `{type:'clone'}` action (confirm-before-act; the CMS card runs the owner clone endpoint). `normalizeAction` guards the action; `onboardCustomer` gained `starterId` (public, whitelisted) + `cloneSourceId` (staff, any site). **Brand-name rewrite (2026-09-11)**: `cloneContent({ rename: { from, to } })` swaps the SOURCE company's name (and its "&" / "and" spellings, whole words, any case) for the new business name in page titles + SEO meta, section content, testimonials, services, categories and team bios; `provisionSite` (seed / Starter) and `cloneSite` both pass `{ from: sourceBrandName(sourceSiteId), to: displayName }`. Before this a tenant provisioned from a Starter kept saying "Argyle & Sons" in its SEO title, stories and location card (found on the Remix Barbers clone; no real tenant affected). `makeRenamer` is exported for one-off repairs. **Media localization (2026-07-09)**: clones no longer share the source's Cloudinary assets — `lib/localizeSiteMedia.js` copies every referenced asset into the new site's own folder (+ site_media rows) and rewrites the references, scheduled fire-and-forget from BOTH `cloneSite` and `provisionSite` after the clone commits (so provisioning stays fast; shared refs render fine during the seconds it takes). Idempotent + `{dryRun}` survey mode; images normalize to capped WebP, videos copy as-is; the demo fleet was backfilled the same day (39 assets, 5 sites). Before this, deleting a source asset silently broke its clones (the per-site "In use" scan can't see cross-site usage) — 2 historical instances found + repaired.

**Stacy CMS copilot (`/api/cms/assistant`, added 2026-06-24)** — `controllers/cms/assistantController.js` + `routes/cms/assistant.js`, `requireCmsAuth` + `verifySiteOwnership`. The CMS chat panel (Agent 5). `POST /init` (start a conversation row), `POST /send` (build site context via `lib/stacyContext.js` `buildSiteContext` + last-~12 history → POST to `STACY_N8N_URL` with `x-leadgen-secret` → persist messages → return `{reply, handoff}`; also auto-titles the conversation from the first user message), `GET /list` + `GET /:id` + **`PATCH /:id`** (rename {title}). Conversations in the additive **`agent_conversations`** table (RLS staff/service-role only). n8n side runs a **native AI Agent node + lmChatOpenAi (GPT-4o)**; iterate the prompt by pasting `~/Documents/stemfra/n8n-workflows/stacy-build-prompt-S2.js` into the workflow's Build Prompt node (no re-import). Env: `STACY_N8N_URL` + `STACY_MODEL`. Onboarding checklist (2026-06-24): `lib/stacyOnboarding.js` + `GET/POST /api/cms/assistant/onboarding` — a 10-step setup checklist (fill steps auto-detected from data, personalize steps owner-marked), progress in `site_theme_settings.metadata.onboarding` (select-then-update/insert, no upsert). S1 (answer) + S2 (draft copy) done; **S3 (act) = site CLONE (2026-07-01, verified live)** — `send` relays a whitelisted `{type:'clone',businessName?}` action (prompt: `stacy-build-prompt-S3.js` + `stacy-parse-S3.js` — the Parse node must carry `action` through); the CMS confirm card runs the owner clone endpoint. Stacy's first mutating tool (confirm-before-act). Handoff is REAL (2026-06-24): `notifyHandoff` writes a `site_activity` audit row (`stacy_handoff_requested`) + a best-effort staff email to `NOTIFY_EMAIL`/`GMAIL_USER` (fire-and-forget; email needs `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`). Full picture in the platform CLAUDE.md "Stacy" entry.

**Front Desk chat (`/api/site-chat`, Agent 2, added 2026-06-24)** — `controllers/siteChatController.js` + `routes/siteChat.js`. **PUBLIC** (no owner auth) — called by the chat widget on a client's template site. `POST /send {siteId, conversationId?, message}`: validate site live/previewing + `site_theme_settings.metadata.frontdesk_enabled === true`; **reuses `lib/stacyContext.js` `buildSiteContext`**; proxy to `FRONTDESK_N8N_URL` (x-leadgen-secret); persist to `agent_conversations` (`agent='frontdesk'`, `created_by=null`). Per-IP+site **in-memory rate limit** (20/min — protects the public endpoint + LLM cost; per-instance). Env: `FRONTDESK_N8N_URL`, `FRONTDESK_MODEL`. Response contract: `{reply, handoff, lead}`. **F1 = answer** (grounded from site context). **F2 = capture lead (done 2026-06-24)**: when the n8n response carries a `lead` object (visitor left name + email/phone), `captureLead()` writes a `site_leads` row — `source_page='Chat assistant'`, `metadata={source:'website_chat', conversation_id, captured_by:'frontdesk', intent}` (the table has NO `source` column; use `source_page`/`metadata`). Idempotent per conversation (dedup by `metadata->>conversation_id` → UPDATE not INSERT). Best-effort owner email, gated to `status='live'`. Leads surface in the CMS Leads inbox. **F3 = book in-chat (done 2026-06-24)**: response contract now `{reply, handoff, lead, booking}`. The agent emits a `booking` object; `send()` runs a **server-orchestrated tool loop** — `lib/frontdeskBooking.js` `runBookingTool()` resolves service/barber/date against real data and returns a `note`; if a note results, `send()` re-invokes the workflow ONCE with `context.booking_system_note` so the agent's reply is grounded in real availability / a real confirmation (max 1 extra round-trip; never invents times). **FREE services book in chat** (confirm step required: `booking.confirm===true` only after the visitor approves a summary); **PRICED services hand off** to the booking page (no card payment in chat). Booking logic is **shared, not duplicated**: `bookingController.js` exports cores `computeAvailability` + `placeBooking` (`allowedStatuses` param — public handlers pass `['live']`, the chat tool passes `['live','previewing']` so it's testable on preview sites). `context` also carries `today` (site-zone date) for relative-date resolution. n8n node scripts (repaste both): `n8n-workflows/frontdesk-build-prompt.js` (Build Prompt — emits `booking`, consumes `today`+`booking_system_note`) + `n8n-workflows/frontdesk-parse.js` (Parse — passes `lead`+`booking`). Widget got a `previewing` prop (lifts above the PreviewRibbon). **Phase 1 structured interaction layer (Mindbody-parity, done 2026-06-24)**: response is now `{reply, conversationId, card, quick_replies}`. `runBookingTool` returns `{note, card, quickReplies}` — real time slots as tappable **chips**, plus structured **cards**: `booking_confirm` (service/staff/date/time/total + Confirm/Not now action buttons), `booking_done`, `handoff_booking` (Open booking page → /book). Server injects exact time chips (overriding the agent's); the agent also emits general `quick_replies` (Yes/No, menus) via the n8n Parse passthrough + Build Prompt persona/handoff. Widget renders chips (last msg only) + `BookingCard`. Blueprint: `stemfra_platform/docs/STACY.md`.

**Payments (`/api/cms/payments`, `controllers/cms/paymentsController.js`)** — Stripe Connect (Express). `POST /connect-link` (create/reuse Express account + onboarding link), `GET /status?siteId=` (refresh capabilities from Stripe; also returns `account.livemode` for the CMS "Test mode" badge), `POST /dashboard-link` (added 2026-06-23 — `stripe.accounts.createLoginLink` → Express dashboard, for the CMS "Manage in Stripe" link), `GET /healthcheck`.

## Staff handover (`/api/admin/handover/*`, P32 phase 1, 2026-09-10)

`controllers/admin/handoverController.js` + `routes/admin/handover.js` (super_admin + admin). `GET /preview?from=&to=` = the leaver's book (leads / deals / outreach_sent_by counts, the clients past first contact with an email = stages contacted…won, not do_not_email, not test), a rendered sample of template **H1** ("New account manager", `email_templates`, part outbound) and the Workspace checklist. `POST /run {from, to, notifyLeadIds, deactivate}` reassigns `leads.assigned_to` + `outreach_sent_by` + `deals.assigned_to` (feed rows `lead_reassigned` / `deal_reassigned`), sends the introduction email to the ticked clients **from the successor's own mailbox** via `gmailOutreach.sendAsRep` (domain-wide delegation works for any @stemfra.com; PECR `emailAllowed` + the compliance footer apply; 1.5 s between sends), then deactivates the profile (`is_active=false`, presence offline, lock PIN deleted). Contacts / companies only carry `created_by`, so they are not reassigned. Workspace steps (forwarding, suspend, alias, delete) stay manual until phase 2 (Admin SDK on the P30 service account). CRM: Team page kebab → "Hand over…" (`components/team/HandoverModal.jsx`, `hooks/useHandover.js`).

## Compliance Engine endpoints (`/api/admin/compliance/*`, 2026-08-10)

Server side of the CRM Compliance page (staff-gated `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, same as billing). `controllers/admin/complianceController.js` + `routes/admin/compliance.js` (mounted in index.js). Spec: `docs/COMPLIANCE_ENGINE.md`. The controller only aggregates money + dates; all tax-law positions live in the CRM's `src/lib/complianceCatalog.js`.

- **`GET /registry`** — per-jurisdiction rolling-12-month rollup of `billing_charges` (status requested/paid), grouped by the client's billing state via `sites.owner_contact_id → contacts.country/state`, split into SaaS (commission + subscription fees) vs domains vs other. **`?includeDemo=true`** (2026-08-10) folds the demo + starter fleet back in — a PREVIEW mode for the CRM Nexus-tracking toggle so staff can see how the table renders pre-revenue; `loadBillableCharges({includeDemo})` bypasses BOTH demo exclusions. Defaults OFF (real clients only); never use it for real nexus determination. **`GET /books?year=`** — monthly PAID revenue by category + monthly `expenses` by category (a tax P&L). **BOTH exclude demo data**: `charge.metadata.demo_seed=true` AND charges whose site has `metadata.is_starter=true` (so the 26 seeded demo invoices + the demo fleet never count toward nexus or the P&L). Today both return empty (all charges are demo/starter → genuinely pre-revenue → 0 nexus).
- **`lib/geo.js`** — country + US-state human-name→code maps + `jurisdictionFor(country, state)` → a stable `US-NY` key + label; since P31 (2026-09-10) also Canadian provinces (`CA-ON`, `caProvinceCode`) and the UK (`GB`). `lib/taxThresholds.js` returns `{sales, currency, txns, firstSale}` per key (CAD 30k for `CA-*`, first sale for `GB`) and `nexusSweeper` alerts on all three countries. `contacts.country/state` store HUMAN NAMES. Independent of the `airwallexBilling.js` country map (do not touch that file).
- CRUD: **`GET/POST /registrations`, `PATCH/DELETE /registrations/:id`** (`compliance_registrations`); **`GET/POST /filings`** (upsert by obligation_key+period, `compliance_filings`); **`GET /settings` + `POST /settings`** (`compliance_settings`, holds the ETBUS determination + action checklist). ⚠ **Settings is POST, not PUT** — the global CORS `methods` list (index.js `app.use(cors({methods:[…]}))`) omits PUT, so a PUT is blocked after a successful OPTIONS preflight. Use POST/PATCH for admin writes, or add PUT to that list.
- **Additive tables** (migration `compliance_engine_v1`, staff RLS via `is_stemfra_staff()`): `compliance_registrations`, `compliance_filings`, `compliance_settings`. All access is server-mediated (service role); the RLS policies are defense-in-depth.

## Billing Reconciliation Engine (`/api/admin/recon/*` + `/api/awx/webhook`, 2026-08-11)

Auto-matches Airwallex deposits against unpaid `billing_charges` so invoices
confirm themselves (tenants no longer upload receipts; receipts are
dispute-only). **Spec + build log: `docs/RECONCILIATION.md` — read it first.**

- **`lib/reconEngine.js`** — deposit fetch (30-day window chunking; the AWX list
  caps ranges at 31 days), tiered matcher (T1 reference / T2 exact / T2-near
  fee-tolerant auto-pay; ambiguity → review), `claimCharge` (tenant "I've
  paid"), reversal handling (un-pays + emails), staff `applyDeposit`/
  `setDepositStatus`. Auto-pay goes through `lib/billing markPaid`, so receipt
  email + AWX mirror settle + pay-and-publish ride along. `recon_deposits`
  table = dedup ledger + review/unmatched/ignored states.
- **`lib/reconSweeper.js`** — self-scheduling backstop; gates: env
  `RECON_ENABLED=true` (NOT in deploy.yml yet — add at arm time) then
  `crm_settings.billing_recon {enabled, dry_run, interval_minutes,
  lookback_days, near_tolerance_cents}` (CRM-adjustable, re-read every cycle).
- **`routes/awxWebhook.js`** (`/api/awx/webhook`, `express.raw` before json) —
  `deposit.pending/settled/rejected/reversed`; HMAC-SHA256(x-timestamp + raw
  body) vs `x-signature` with `AIRWALLEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (env + deploy.yml;
  dashboard webhook `stemfra-deposit-recon` registered by Peter).
- **`routes/admin/recon.js`** (PLATFORM_ADMIN) — deposits list, resolve,
  ignore/restore, settings, on-demand sweep, per-charge `request-receipt`
  (toggles `metadata.receipt_requested` + `platformReceiptRequest` email). CRM
  surface: the Billing page's Reconciliation tab (stemfra-ops).
- **CMS side**: `POST /api/cms/billing/charges/:id/claim` ("I've paid" → live
  targeted check → paid or Processing); receipt upload hidden unless requested.
- **Rounding policy (final)**: commission = EXACT 5% to the cent (brand
  promise); domain retail rounds UP to whole dollars (`lib/registrar/porkbun.js`).
- Invoice PDF + email print the 8-char **payment reference** (bare code; USD
  bank memos cap at 10 chars, so `INV-…` would truncate and break matching).

## Document export endpoints (`/api/export/*`, 2026-07-20)

Server-side export for **stemfra_business** (`routes/export.js`, `requireStaffAuth`): the browser sends the EXACT rendered HTML + its collected stylesheets, and headless Chromium (Playwright — same dep as the mockups) returns output pixel-identical to the on-screen render. This exists because client-side approaches all failed a leg of the triangle: browser `window.print()` adds unremovable header/footer junk, html2canvas approximates (cream-background/flex-centering bugs), and pdfmake re-lays-out in Roboto.

- `POST /pdf` `{ html, pdf? }` → `page.setContent(waitUntil:'networkidle')` + `document.fonts.ready` → `page.pdf({ printBackground: true, ...pdf })` → `application/pdf`. Real selectable text; margins/page-size from the doc's own CSS `@page` (decks pass `preferCSSPageSize`, agreements pass `format:'A4'` + the app's `@page agreements { margin: 2.54cm }` applies). page.pdf adds NO browser header/footer.
- `POST /images` `{ pages:[html], viewport?, scale? }` → sequential setContent + screenshot per page → `{ images: [dataURL] }` (retina PNGs; the client embeds them into PPTX/DOCX).
- `GET /healthcheck` → launches+closes Chromium.

**Mounted BEFORE the global `express.json({limit:'10kb'})`** (Stripe-webhook precedent) — payloads are multi-MB; the route carries its own `express.json({limit:'60mb'})`. Client bridge: `stemfra_business/src/lib/export/serverExport.ts` (collects `document.styleSheets` cssText — includes the Google-Fonts `@import`s — plus a `<base href>` so relative assets resolve from :5183). **Prod caveat:** same as mockups — chromium must be in the Docker image, and the `<base>` origin must be a host the server can reach (localhost:5183 is dev-only; the business app is currently a local tool).

## Business app endpoint (`/api/business/*`, 2026-07-16)

Serves the **stemfra_business** app (staff-only business-plan / pitch-deck builder at `localhost:5183`). `routes/business.js` + `lib/businessAssist.js`. Document PERSISTENCE is NOT here — it lives in the browser via the `business_documents` table + staff RLS (the app writes directly, no server round-trip). This route only serves the **AI drafting copilot**, which needs the server-held `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
- `GET /assist/healthcheck` — `{ ok, configured, model }`.
- `POST /assist` — `requireStaffAuth`. Body `{ mode: 'draft'|'edit', instruction, context?, blockType?, block? }` → returns `{ block }` (one block's content object; the client re-attaches id/visible/type). Uses GPT (`BUSINESS_MODEL` → `LEADGEN_MODEL` → `gpt-4o`), consistent with the 2026-06-26 "back-office drafting standardizes on OpenAI" decision (same key as leadgenDraft/voiceBrain). System prompt carries the block-shape catalog + the "pre-revenue, never fabricate traction/stats" guardrail; `live-metric`/`divider` are never AI-drafted. CORS: `localhost:5183` added to the allowlist.

`business_documents` table (staff-only RLS via `is_stemfra_staff()`): `{ id, slug (unique), kind, title, blocks jsonb, created_at, updated_at, updated_by }`. One row per document-type slug for v1. Purely additive/isolated — no other app references it. Full app docs: `stemfra_business/CLAUDE.md`.

## CMS auth middleware

`middleware/cmsAuth.js`. Exports three helpers used by the upload routes (and intended for every future CMS endpoint):

- **`requireCmsAuth(req, res, next)`** — Express middleware. Reads `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, calls `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` to validate, and attaches `req.cmsUser = { id, email }` on success. Returns 401 on missing/invalid token.
- **`verifySiteOwnership(authUserId, siteId)`** — Returns the `sites` row if the auth user owns it (via `sites.owner_contact_id → contacts.auth_user_id`), or `null` if not. Every CMS endpoint that takes a `siteId` MUST call this before doing any write.
- **`resolveContactId(authUserId)`** — Looks up the `contacts.id` for the auth user. Used when stamping `uploaded_by` on `site_media` rows.

All three use the service-role client imported from `config/supabase.js`. There is no second anon-keyed client — the service-role client introspects user JWTs via `supabase.auth.getUser()` directly, which is supported and the convention here.

## Platform booking endpoints

These are the public-facing endpoints called by the customer template sites. All five live under `/api/site-forms/*` and `/api/site-bookings/*`. The expensive booking-engine logic lives in `controllers/bookingController.js`.

- **`POST /api/site-forms/newsletter`** — `subscribeNewsletter` in `controllers/siteFormController.js` (added 2026-07-10). Footer newsletter signup: `{siteId, email}` → `site_newsletter_subscribers` insert. Gates: valid email, site live/previewing, per-IP+site in-memory rate limit (10/min); duplicates return success silently (unique site+lower(email) — never leaks list membership). Owners read the list in the CMS **Subscribers** page (Operations).
- **`POST /api/site-forms/lead`** — `submitSiteLead` in `controllers/siteFormController.js`. Contact-form submission. Validates the target site is `status='live'`, writes a `site_leads` row, emails the owner via Nodemailer/Gmail. Email failure does NOT fail the request (best-effort).
- **`GET /api/site-bookings/availability`** — `getAvailability` in `controllers/bookingController.js`. Returns a 15-minute availability grid for `(siteId, teamMemberId, serviceId, date)`. Filters past dates, applies the team member's `site_availability` rules, subtracts existing bookings, enforces back-to-back-is-not-overlap.
- **`GET /api/site-bookings/month`** — `getMonthAvailability`. Month-level availability for the calendar widget. Same engine logic, run per day.
- **`POST /api/site-bookings`** — `createBooking`. Single-service booking write. Re-checks the requested slot against the engine, upserts the customer record, writes the `site_bookings` row, sends confirmation email.
- **`POST /api/site-bookings/group`** — `createBookingGroup`. Multi-service basket write (salons template only). Does a self-conflict pre-check on the basket, per-item DB re-check, then partial-success semantics: creates a `site_booking_groups` row only if at least one child succeeds; successful children get a `group_id`; failed children are returned for re-pick. One summary email per group.

CORS for these endpoints is hardcoded in `index.js` to explicitly list each dev port (5174 barbers, 5175 salons, 5176 crossfit, 5177 yoga) plus the production marketing/CRM/CMS origins. Production CORS is currently static — a known deferred item.

## CRM Twilio / presence / leadgen

These are CRM-side concerns called by `stemfra-ops` (the internal CRM at `localhost:5173`).

**`routes/twilio.js`** — voice + SMS + recording webhooks. Mounted at `/api/twilio/*`. The 12 endpoints:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/token` | Voice SDK access token for the CRM browser |
| POST | `/sms/send` | Outbound SMS |
| POST | `/sms-status` | Twilio status callback (delivered/failed) |
| POST | `/sms-inbound` | Twilio inbound SMS webhook |
| POST | `/voice` | Outbound voice TwiML (`<Number url>` whisper for [disclosure leg](../twilio_disclosure_legs_gotcha.md)) |
| POST | `/recording-disclosure` | The whisper TwiML target |
| POST | `/voice-status` | Twilio voice status callback |
| POST | `/recording-status` | Twilio recording status callback |
| POST | `/inbound-voice` | Twilio inbound voice webhook (top-level `<Say>` disclosure) |
| POST | `/inbound-dial-result` | Inbound `<Dial>` result handling |
| POST | `/voicemail-complete` | Voicemail recording complete |
| GET | `/recording/:callId` | Signed recording URL fetch |

**Every URL Twilio can hit as a TwiML target must answer TwiML** (2026-09-11 lesson): `/voice-status` is also the `<Dial action>`; it used to reply `OK`, so Twilio raised 12100 and read "an application error has occurred, goodbye" to the rep after every unanswered or hung-up dial. It now returns an empty `<Response/>`. Status-only callbacks (`sms-status`, `recording-status`) may keep plain 200 bodies; anything reachable via `action=` / `url=` may not.

Activity-feed inserts use a `logActivity({ action, entityType, entityId, actorId, actorName, entityName, details })` helper defined inline in `routes/twilio.js` (~line 103). It writes to the same `crm_activity_log` table the ops CRM's own `logActivity` helper writes to. If/when a second route file needs to log activity, lift this helper into `lib/activity.js` rather than duplicating it.

**`routes/workTime.js` + `lib/workTime.js` (P29 phase 1, 2026-09-10)** — staff working-time monitor. The presence heartbeat now carries `{idle, in_call, last_active_at, dnd}`; `startWorkTimeSweeper()` (index.js, every 60s) opens/closes `work_sessions` from fresh non-idle beats and rolls `work_days` per rep per SHIFT (`profiles.shift` else `crm_settings.work_time.default_shift`; only in-shift minutes count). Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/work-time/settings` (POST super_admin; ranges enforced in `normalizeSettings`), `GET /me`, `GET /team` (super_admin/admin/manager/sales_manager), `PATCH /shift/:userId`. Migration `docs/migrations/work_time_v1.sql`. **Phase 2 (lock PIN):** `GET/POST/DELETE /api/work-time/pin` + `POST /pin/verify` on `staff_lock_pins` (scrypt, per-user salt, 5 wrong tries → 15-minute lockout; table has RLS with NO policies = service role only, deliberately not a `user_settings` column because that row is returned whole to the client). Migration `work_time_v2_lock_pin.sql`. **Phase 3 (absences):** `GET/POST /api/work-time/absences`, `PATCH/DELETE /absences/:id` on `staff_absences`; approved minutes → `work_days.excused_minutes` (rollup re-run for that day via `shiftWindowForDay`); bells via `supabase.rpc('crm_notify')` (`absence_request` to team roles, `absence_approved|rejected` to the rep). Migration `work_time_v3_absences.sql`. `GET /team` = active `@stemfra.com` profiles only. **Phase 4:** `closeShifts()` (in the minute sweep) freezes ended shifts (`closed_at`, status) and bells `work_day_short` for tracked roles on work days; `weeklySummary()` Monday 09:00 (default shift tz, state in `crm_settings.work_time_state`) → `work_week` bell + `renderEmail` email to team roles. Settings: `work_days`, `tracked_roles`, `weekly_summary`. Migration `work_time_v4_alerts.sql`. Verify with `closeShifts({dryRun:true})` / `buildWeeklySummary()`; never `weeklySummary({force:true})` casually, it emails the managers. Design + phases: `stemfra-ops/docs/SALES_HOURS.md`.

**`routes/presence.js`** — CRM user online/offline tracking. `POST /api/presence/heartbeat`, `POST /api/presence/offline`. Plus `startStalePresenceSweeper({ intervalMs: 60_000, staleMs: 150_000 })` — a `setInterval` background task started from `index.js` after `app.listen` succeeds. Every 60 seconds it flips any CRM users whose last heartbeat is older than 150 seconds to offline. The 150s threshold gives 5 missed heartbeats of slack to account for browser throttling of `setInterval` in hidden tabs.

**`lib/leadCountry.js` + per-market senders (P31 section 2, 2026-09-10)** — `countryForLead(lead)` (phone_country → region's country → US) is the ONE way to get a lead's ISO-2; `leadgenCall.toE164(phone, country)` parses with libphonenumber in that country (UK/Canadian local numbers get their own code), and every caller passes `countryForLead(lead)` (never `lead.phone_country` alone; selects must include `region`). `config/twilio.js` models TWO lines per market, like the US (Peter's rule 2026-09-10: a prospect expects the text from the number that called, and a callback to reach whoever called): the **staff line** `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER[_GB|_CA]` (`staffLine` / `staffLineForNumber`: the reps' dialer caller ID, Claim SMS, owner alerts, consent confirmation; inbound Voice URL `/api/twilio/inbound-voice`, SMS `/api/twilio/sms-inbound`) and **Mark's line** `VOICE_PHONE_NUMBER[_GB|_CA]` (`markLine` / `markLineForNumber`: `placeAiCall` + the text Mark sends in-call; inbound Voice URL `/api/voice/concierge/incoming`). `smsFrom`/`voiceFrom`/`smsFromForNumber`/`voiceFromForNumber` are aliases of those. Blank market vars fall back to the US lines. Never assign one number to both roles. UK mobile numbers text UK handsets only. `outreachCompliance.emailAllowed(lead)` is the UK PECR gate (`leads.entity_type` must be `company` for a GB lead): call it before any cold or follow-up email send; selects on those paths must include `region, entity_type`.

**`lib/leadVertical.js` + `leads.vertical` (2026-09-11)** — the ONE way to read a lead's vertical (`verticalOfLead(lead)` → barbershop | beauty_salon | crossfit | yoga_pilates | massage | spa). The column (migration `docs/migrations/leads_vertical_v1.sql`, applied) is backfilled from `qualification.vertical` then the legacy design-gallery `template_slug` ('barber' → barbershop…), and a BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger fills it for writers that only know those legacy fields (the n8n lead-gen insert). Never read `template_slug` for a vertical again; it stays only as the legacy quote/demo-link hint. **Contact form subjects**: `contactController` accepts the six "<Vertical> website" subjects the marketing form sends (they were rejected as "Invalid subject selected" from the moment the verticals replaced the old service list; only "General" got through) → `service: 'website'` + `leads.vertical`.

**Lead SMS conversations (2026-09-11)** — the CRM's lead drawer has a Messages panel that sends through `POST /api/twilio/sms/send` (production only, per the Twilio rule). The route now merges `{{first_name}} {{business_name}} {{rep_name}} {{demo_link}} {{claim_link}}` from the lead when `leadId` is given (`fillOutreachLinks` + `lib/claimTokens`), appends `outreachCompliance.smsSignOff` for CA/UK numbers, picks the market sender via `smsFromForNumber`, and stores the MERGED text in `sms_messages` + the activity log. Text templates live in `email_templates` with `channel = 'sms'` (S1 missed-you, S2 website-built, S3 free-website) and `channel = 'voicemail'` (V1, a script, never sent); migration `docs/migrations/sms_templates_v1.sql` (applied) also adds `sms_messages.read_at` for the CRM's unread badges. `POST /sms-inbound` bells the lead's `assigned_to` through `supabase.rpc('crm_notify', {kind:'sms_reply', route:'/leads?lead=<id>'})` on top of the existing activity insert. Consent stays the CRM's gate (`leads.sms_consent_at` from Send Claim, or an inbound text); the server does not send cold texts on its own. **Consent provenance (migration `lead_sms_consent_v2.sql`, applied 2026-09-11):** `sms_consent_source` (send_claim | verbal_call | inbound_text | form), `sms_consent_by`, `sms_consent_note`. Send Claim stamps `send_claim` only when no consent exists yet; the CRM's "Owner agreed on the call" records `verbal_call` with the call SID (the recording is the proof Twilio may ask for; Twilio accepts a documented verbal opt-in, see `docs/OUTREACH.md` §6b). Never stamp consent from code paths that did not hear a yes. **Not relevant numbers** (migration `sms_ignored_numbers_v1.sql`, applied): `/sms-inbound` looks the sender up in `sms_ignored_numbers` (staff tag it from the CRM's Texts tab) and files a match with `dismissed_at` + `read_at` set, no bell and no activity row; the STOP handling still runs first. Recycled Twilio numbers make this necessary (a UK debt collector texting our UK line's previous holder, 2026-09-11).

**`lib/outreachCompliance.js` (P31, 2026-09-10)** — the one place that knows CAN-SPAM / CASL / PECR: `marketFor(lead)` from `leads.region` or `phone_country`, `emailFooter` (identification + reply-stop, appended by the sequencer), `identificationLine` (under the claim email's reason line via `senderIdentification`), `smsSignOff` (Stemfra named in the Claim SMS for CA/UK leads). Set `STEMFRA_MAILING_ADDRESS` (.env + deploy.yml) so the footer carries the postal address; plain text, no links. Rules table: `docs/OUTREACH.md` §6.

**`routes/leadgen.js`** — `POST /api/leadgen/trigger` proxies CRM lead-gen requests to the n8n workflows at `N8N_LEADGEN_COLD_URL` or `N8N_LEADGEN_WARM_URL`. Sends `x-leadgen-secret: ${N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET}` — the n8n workflow verifies before doing anything. Returns 503 if the corresponding URL env var is unset. See the [Lead-Gen module architecture](../leadgen_module_architecture.md) memory for the full CRM ↔ stemfra-server ↔ n8n flow. **The outreach side (Template Manager A1–A20/B1–B9, Mark's Gmail sends, the A1→A2→read-gated-call→A8→A20 drip, voice guardrails, and the A1-template injection into the scoring agent) is documented in [docs/OUTREACH.md](docs/OUTREACH.md) — read it before touching send-outreach / the sequencer / the n8n prompt.** The trigger also passes the active A1 template as `payload.template_a1` (2026-07-10) so the agent drafts inside the agreed structure.

**`routes/speedToLead.js`** — `POST /api/speed-to-lead/engage`. Same pattern as leadgen, separate n8n workflow; the trigger logs the arrival and flips status either way, and the CRM's escalation scan is the backstop.

**Marketing site adjacent (not CRM but bundled here):**
- `routes/contact.js` — `POST /api/contact` (marketing site form), `GET /api/contact` (admin list).
- `routes/insights.js` — CRUD for the `/blog`/Insights public content. GET/list, GET/:slug, POST, PATCH/:slug, DELETE/:slug.
- `routes/userSettings.js` — `GET`, `PATCH /api/user-settings`. CRM user prefs.
- `routes/devPreview.js` — dev-only email template previews under `/dev/preview`, gated by `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

## Marketing Mockups endpoints (`/api/admin/mockups/*` + `/api/marketing/*`, 2026-07-03/04)

Serves the CRM's **Marketing → Mockups** studio (full doc: `stemfra-ops/docs/MARKETING_MOCKUPS.md` — read it before touching these). New deps: **`playwright`** (+ chromium binary) and **`sharp`**. Files: `controllers/admin/mockupsController.js` + `routes/admin/mockups.js` (staff-gated `PLATFORM_OPS`) + `routes/marketing.js` (public).

- `POST /capture` — Playwright renders the CRM's chrome-less `/render/mockup` route (env `MOCKUP_RENDER_URL`; dev `localhost:5178`, prod `https://crm.stemfra.com`) at 1–4× → sharp WebP → Cloudinary `stemfra_assets/mockups`.
- `GET /assets` · `POST /upload` (busboy — **must `req.pipe(bb)`**) · `POST /assets/delete` (folder-guarded) — the brand-asset sources library (`stemfra_assets/mockups/sources`).
- `POST /screenshot-demo` — screenshots a DEMO PAGE: `{starterId, path}` only (server resolves the URL via `lib/starters previewUrlFor` — SSRF-safe); hides the preview ribbon + chat launcher; `fullPage` mode returns an inline 2× base64 master; `clip` mode re-captures a region at 4× (fit-capped to WebP 16383/side + ~24MP).
- `POST /prepare-page` · `GET /masters` · `POST /crop-master` — **prepared masters**: a demo page rendered ONCE at 4× and stored as Cloudinary TILES (≤~24MP each; the tile map on the demo's `metadata.mockup_masters`); `crop-master` sharp-stitches any region (or the whole page, auto-fit) without re-rendering.
- `GET /saved` · `POST /save` · `POST /delete-saved` — composed mockups persisted on the demo's `metadata.marketing_mockups` (read-modify-write; preserves `is_starter` etc.).
- **PUBLIC** `GET /api/marketing/mockups` — newest saved `finalUrl` per demo keyed by subdomain; consumed by `stemfra_client` `WorkMarquee` (fallback-preserving).
- **Prod deploy prerequisites: ✅ DONE (verified in prod 2026-08-04** — `GET https://api.stemfra.com/api/export/healthcheck` returns `{"ok":true}`, which launches and closes Chromium, so the browser + sharp are in the Docker image; Peter confirmed the mockup pipeline checked out in production). An earlier version of this line said NOT done and outlived the fix.

**Site imagery (marketing_assets, 2026-07-09)** — every STANDALONE photo on stemfra.com (hero backdrops, vertical photos, About/Start/Contact) is a slot row in the `marketing_assets` table (dot-path slots like `home.hero.photo` → Cloudinary `stemfra_assets/marketing/*`). `controllers/admin/marketingAssetsController.js` + `routes/admin/marketingAssets.js` (`/api/admin/marketing-assets` — list/upload/patch/delete, `PLATFORM_OPS`) + public `GET /api/marketing/assets`. Client reads via `stemfra_client` `lib/marketingAssets.js` `useMarketingAsset(slot)`; **NO fallback slots by design** — a missing slot hides the surface. Managed from the CRM's Marketing → Site imagery tab. Distinct from demo mockups (`metadata.marketing_mockups`).

CORS additions: dev origins `5178` (CRM), `5181`/`5182` (massage/spa templates).

## Stemfra Voice agent (Agent 3 — "Mark")

`routes/voice.js` → `controllers/voiceController.js` (Twilio ConversationRelay WS at `/voice/relay`) → `lib/voiceBrain.js` (GPT-4o streaming, concierge knowledge); outbound warm calls via `lib/leadgenCall.js`. In-call memory = 60-message window + never-re-ask rule + caller-ID awareness (2026-07-21 fix — the old 12-msg window made it re-ask for details and deny having the caller's number). **Baseline scorecard vs the Retell/Thoughtly 2026 evaluations + the 5-phase improvement roadmap: `docs/VOICE_AGENT.md`** (ROADMAP arc P11). Phases 0–2 SHIPPED 2026-07-21/22 (support routing/transcripts/dispositions/outbound-dedup · speed-to-lead/live-transfer/recap/AMD-voicemail/missed-call-SMS · caller-ID identification via `lib/voiceAccount.js` + account context + `[ACTION:reset_password|ticket|callback]` tools with server-side identity guards). ⚠ Test rig: the demo owner contact (Marcus Argyle) carries Peter's phone +13026874540 so Peter's calls exercise the identified path. Phase 0 SHIPPED 2026-07-21: support-intent routing (support calls → support@ email + `voice_call_support` activity, never a sales-lead insert), transcripts persisted on `activity_feed`, structured dispositions/sentiment/plan in outcomes, and outbound calls UPDATE the source lead via the new `leadId` custom parameter (no duplicate inserts). CRM activity logging now goes through the lifted `lib/activity.js logActivity` (twilio.js re-imports it).

## Verticals registry note (2026-07-04)

`lib/verticalConfig.js`: **massage** added (wellness pillar; seed **`lull`** (renamed from `calm-roots-massage`, which is dead), a **generated UUID, not a sentinel**), **spa** deferred (built from massage later), **boutique_gyms removed** (retired). Lead-gen allow-list derives from it; the CRM dropdown carries massage + spa; **n8n synced 2026-07-10** (six-vertical prompt pasted by Peter — the 3-place sync rule now points at `n8n-workflows/leadgen-system-prompt.txt` as the paste source).

## Keeping Stacy (+ the publish checklist) in sync with CMS changes (2026-07-08)

Two server surfaces tell an owner "go here to fix X" in the browser CMS: the
**publish checklist** (`lib/siteCompleteness.js`) and **Stacy's onboarding**
(`lib/stacyOnboarding.js`). They must never drift again:

- **CMS routes = ONE source of truth: `lib/cmsRoutes.js`** (`CMS_ROUTES` map +
  `contentRoute(slug)`). BOTH consumers import from it. When a CMS route or
  settings anchor changes (like the Settings split, where bare `/settings` now
  REDIRECTS and drops query+hash), edit `cmsRoutes.js` once → checklist + Stacy
  update together. Keep it aligned with `stemfra_cms/src/App.tsx` +
  `settingsSections.ts`. (The CMS `StacyPanel.tsx` `ROUTE_LABEL` map also needs
  its keys kept in step for the guidance text — it has a `/settings`/`/content`
  prefix fallback so it degrades gracefully.)
- **Stacy's DATA context (`lib/stacyContext.js` `buildSiteContext`) live-reads
  the DB**, so content edits (services/team/pages/hours/social/leads/bookings +
  now blog + active theme) auto-sync — Stacy always sees current data. When a
  NEW owner-facing surface ships (a new table/section type), add it here so Stacy
  isn't blind to it (the one manual step; everything data-shaped after that is
  automatic). Front Desk (Agent 2) reuses this builder, so both agents benefit.

## Legal documents + acceptance ledger (2026-08-18, launch task #5)

`lib/legalDocs.js` = ONE registry of the legal documents (Terms / Privacy / Fees /
Refund / SMS), their CURRENT version (= the "Last updated" date on the
stemfra_client page) and URL, plus `recordLegalAcceptance()` → the additive
`legal_acceptances` table. Public signup (`POST /api/onboarding/signup`, both
the CMS `/signup` and `stemfra.com/start` forms) MUST send `termsAccepted:true`
(one tick = Terms + Privacy + Fees) or gets `400 terms_required`; the server
stamps `accepted_at` + versions + ip + user-agent itself (never the client).
`GET /api/public-config` exposes `legal` so forms link the same documents. Staff
paths pass `requireTerms:false` (accept-at-first-login is a follow-up). **When a
legal page changes materially: bump the version in `legalDocs.js` AND the page's
"Last updated" line together.** Deploy order for a change to the requirement:
client + platform (forms) BEFORE server (the check).

## Test / demo data isolation (2026-08-18, launch task #9)

`lib/testData.js` is the ONE predicate: `siteKind(site)` = `'test'` (`metadata.is_test`)
| `'demo'` (`metadata.is_starter`, the public Starter fleet) | `'real'`; `isNonProductionSite`
= demo OR test. Every money/metrics consumer routes through it (commission meter,
booking auto-collect + membership-renewal sweepers, compliance/books, admin sites
list + monitor). Never re-derive `is_starter` in a new consumer. Test tenants are
flagged by staff (`POST /api/admin/sites/:id/test-flag`) or automatically at signup
when the owner email is on `TEST_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (env; default stemfra.com,
example.com). `leads.is_test` marks CRM test leads. Cleanup = `lib/testDataCleanup.js`
via `scripts/cleanup-test-data.js` (dry-run default, `--apply`) or
`POST /api/admin/test-data/cleanup` (PLATFORM_ADMIN; `{apply:true}` to purge).

## Future architecture: planned CMS service split

All CMS endpoints live under `/api/cms/*` and CMS-only code is isolated under `routes/cms/` + `controllers/cms/`. `middleware/cmsAuth.js` is also CMS-only. This isolation is intentional: it establishes a clean seam so that, when the moment is right, the CMS becomes its own service without a refactor.

**Triggers for the split — split when any 2 of these are true, not before:**

1. CMS endpoints reach 15+ routes (currently 4: upload, delete, list, healthcheck).
2. A real bug in CRM/Twilio code actually breaks a CMS endpoint (or vice versa).
3. CMS and CRM/Platform need genuinely different scaling profiles (e.g. CMS is bursty around customer site launches; CRM/Twilio is steady).
4. A team member (or contractor) needs to work on CMS without touching CRM code.
5. The combined deploy pipeline becomes a bottleneck — e.g. CMS hotfixes blocked behind unrelated Twilio rollouts.

**Split mechanics (when triggered):**

- Move `routes/cms/`, `controllers/cms/`, `middleware/cmsAuth.js` into a new repo (e.g. `stemfra_cms_server`).
- Both services share the same Supabase project (`acxepovfklgthxmteqxr`) — no schema migration required.
- Both services use the same Cloudinary credentials (same `cloud_name`, separate API keys per service for revocation).
- CORS on the new CMS service includes only the CMS frontend origin (`http://localhost:5180` in dev, the production CMS host).
- The CMS frontend changes its `SERVER_BASE` constant (currently in `lib/useUpload.ts` and `lib/useDeleteMedia.ts`) to point at the new host. Nothing else changes in the customer-facing CMS code.

This is deliberate deferral — split when there is operational evidence justifying it, not before.

## Production deploy

GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` redeploys the Docker Compose stack on the Hostinger VPS on every push to `main`. The workflow uses `hostinger/deploy-on-vps@v2`, which calls Hostinger's internal API to redeploy the matching Docker Manager Compose project.

The workflow's `environment-variables` block is the **single source of truth** for production env. Hostinger's deploy action REPLACES (not merges) the project's Environment panel — any var omitted from this block gets wiped on deploy. `.env.example` is local-dev documentation only.

Required GitHub Actions secrets (set in repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
- `HOSTINGER_API_KEY` (and `HOSTINGER_VM_ID` variable)
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
- All six `TWILIO_*` secrets
- `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `N8N_SPEED_TO_LEAD_URL`
- **`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`** — added in Slice 2c

**✓ Resolved (verified 2026-07-10):** deploy.yml's `environment-variables` block now includes the three `CLOUDINARY_*` vars (lines ~115–117), so deploys no longer wipe Cloudinary env. The GitHub secrets were already set.

Post-deploy verification:

```bash
curl https://api.stemfra.com/api/cms/site-uploads/healthcheck
```

Should return `{"ok":true,"cloudinary_configured":true,"endpoint":"cms/site-uploads","version":"2c"}`. If `cloudinary_configured` is `false`, the deploy workflow's `environment-variables` block is missing the Cloudinary vars (most likely cause) or the GitHub Secrets aren't set.

The VPS is on Hostinger and has had [recurring edge outages](../hostinger_vps_edge_outages.md) — Cloudflare proxy mitigation is already in place. Standard diagnostic ladder via Hostinger's browser console.

## Working conventions

These are mandatory unless explicitly overridden.

- **🛑 Twilio only from the production server (STRICT, Peter 2026-09-09).** Every Twilio interaction, whether a REST API request, a voice call or an SMS, is made by the deployed server at api.stemfra.com, never from Peter's Mac or a Claude session: no `node -r dotenv/config -e` probes with the Twilio credentials, no curl against api.twilio.com, no test sends from a script, no local server on a Cloudflare tunnel receiving Twilio webhooks, no status-polling loops. Diagnosis goes through a staff-gated endpoint on this server or the Twilio Console. If a test send is unavoidable: one message, from production, to Peter's own number. Reason: on 2026-09-08 Twilio's fraud model restricted the whole account (voice, subaccounts, Lookup, number buys, 10DLC at risk) over exactly this traffic from the Mac's IP. Same rule in the CRM, stemfra_ai and the Helen CRM.
- **Supabase import is single-var, not destructured.** `config/supabase.js` exports the client directly (`module.exports = supabase`), so the convention across every controller/route is `const supabase = require('../config/supabase')`. The destructured form `const { supabase } = require(...)` would yield `undefined` and break every call. New files (including `middleware/cmsAuth.js` and `controllers/cms/uploadController.js`) follow the same convention with an inline comment explaining the choice.
- **Ownership checks via `verifySiteOwnership` for every endpoint that takes a `siteId`.** The auth middleware proves the JWT belongs to a real user. `verifySiteOwnership` proves that user owns the target site. Both are required for any write; uploadController calls them in the right order. New CMS endpoints in future slices should follow this pattern verbatim.
- **CMS endpoints isolated under `routes/cms/` + `controllers/cms/`.** Every future CMS route belongs there, not in the top-level `routes/`. This isolation is what makes the section-9 split a config change rather than a refactor.
- **Activity logs via the existing `logActivity` helper.** Today the helper is defined inline at the top of `routes/twilio.js` (~line 103). When a second route file needs to log activity, lift it into a shared `lib/activity.js` and re-import from both — don't duplicate.
- **Email is best-effort.** Confirmation, notification, and alert emails never fail the originating request; failures are logged. **Sending goes through ONE path — `lib/mailer.js` `sendMail({fromName, to, replyTo, subject, text, html})`** (N5 cutover, 2026-07-13), which routes to **Resend** (HTTP API, verified sending domain `mail.stemfra.com`) or **Gmail SMTP** by `EMAIL_PROVIDER` (`resend`|`gmail`, default falls back to whichever is configured). Callers pass a display NAME, never a from-address — the mailer picks the right sending address per provider (`RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS=notifications@mail.stemfra.com`). Do NOT create a new `nodemailer.createTransport` in a controller — route through `sendMail`. **All transactional mail renders through `templates/baseEmail.js`** (Case 9 — one branded base, Stemfra + tenant brand modes; builders in `templates/transactionalEmails.js`; preview every variant at `/dev/preview` in dev). **Stemfra mode was redesigned 2026-07-21 (Peter — the "Bentley register")**: chocolate `#211c18` header/footer bands with the icon-over-wordmark lockup (hosted at `stemfra_assets/email/s-mark-cream.png`, override via `STEMFRA_EMAIL_LOGO_URL`), light 300-weight Helvetica display type, tracked-out uppercase micro-labels, hairline `sRows`, one big `amountBlock` moment (billing), square chocolate + ghost `cta`/`cta2` buttons, and a chocolate footer (links row, uppercase reason line, `© YEAR STEMFRA LLC | STEMFRA.COM | SUPPORT@STEMFRA.COM`). New optional renderEmail params: `eyebrow`, `amount`, `cta2`. The violet `T.accent` is legacy/tenant-fallback only. **TENANT mode was redesigned too (Case 2 — `tenantDocument()` in baseEmail.js, popup style).** An earlier version of this line said Case 2 was pending; the 2026-08-04 audit found the implementation shipped and three docs never followed. ⚠ The 4 Supabase auth templates are pasted MANUALLY into the Supabase dashboard — after this redesign they must be re-pasted (docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_EMAILS.md runbook; Peter action). Always pass BOTH `html` and a plain-`text` alternative. Outreach (Mark's 1:1 prospecting mail) is deliberately UNSTYLED personal plain text via n8n/Gmail — NOT this mailer (see docs/OUTREACH.md).
- **DNS on our own Cloudflare zones → `lib/cloudflareDns.js`** (`upsertDnsRecord`/`upsertDnsRecords`/`deleteDnsRecord`/`listDnsRecords`; idempotent; `proxied:false` default for MX/TXT/verification; targets `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`=stemfra.com or a zone by name). Used to wire the Resend MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC records; reuse it for any future ESP/verification/subdomain record instead of an inline `node -e` script. Distinct from `lib/cloudflareZones.js` `createZoneRecord` (TENANT custom-domain zones, proxied by default).
- **Twilio webhook signatures.** Inbound webhooks from Twilio are signed; `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is required for signature validation. `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is required to reconstruct the URL Twilio signed against. Both must match production for signatures to verify.
- **n8n webhook URLs use the public hostname**, not loopback. See the [Docker container loopback gotcha](../docker_container_loopback_gotcha.md) memory.
- **Twilio disclosure-leg whispers.** Outbound calls use `<Number url>` whisper TwiML; inbound calls use top-level `<Say>`. Don't mix these up — spec drafts have gotten this wrong twice. See the [Twilio disclosure leg gotcha](../twilio_disclosure_legs_gotcha.md) memory.
- **Don't kill or restart this server if port 4000 is already in use.** Peter often runs it in his own terminal while a Claude session is editing files. Edit in place, let nodemon reload, then `curl` against the running instance.
