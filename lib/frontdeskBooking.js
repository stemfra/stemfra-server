// Front Desk (Agent 2), F3 — in-chat booking tool (server-orchestrated).
//
// The chat agent emits a `booking` object each turn (intent, service, barber,
// date, time, customer, confirm). This module turns that into REAL action against
// the native booking engine and returns a `note` — a short system message the
// chat controller injects into the agent's NEXT turn so the agent's reply is
// grounded in real availability / a real confirmation (never invented times).
//
// Policy (Peter, 2026-06-24):
//   • Book in chat with an explicit confirm step (confirm=true only after the
//     visitor approves a summary).
//   • FREE services book directly here; PRICED services hand off to the booking
//     page so card payment stays intact — we never take payment in chat.
//
// Booking logic is reused (not duplicated) from controllers/bookingController.js
// via the exported cores; allowedStatuses includes 'previewing' so the feature
// is testable on preview sites (the public booking page stays live-only).
