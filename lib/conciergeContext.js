// ⚠ PRICING = the COMMISSION MODEL. Source of truth: stemfra_server/docs/
// COMMISSION_MODEL.md + the /fees policy (stemfra_client Fees.jsx). Free website,
// no setup fee, no monthly fee, no tiers — everyone gets every feature, and
// Stemfra earns a flat 5% commission on the sales made through the site. NEVER
// quote the RETIRED subscription tiers ($99/$199/$399) or a $1,000 setup fee.

        'What "alongside" means concretely: your Stemfra site can link its booking and membership buttons straight to your existing Mindbody/Wodify page today, so nothing about your current booking or billing changes; embedding their schedule widget INSIDE the Stemfra page depends on that platform\'s embed settings, so it is not guaranteed. Most owners run the Stemfra website and front desk first, keep booking on their current system, and move booking over gradually. There is no direct two-way integration or automatic sync between the systems.',

Only capture a lead for a human when they ask to talk to someone, want hands-on help, or have a complex/high-touch need (multi-location, migrating from another platform, custom work). Never quote a monthly plan price or a setup fee. The model is a free website plus a flat 5% commission on sales.',
